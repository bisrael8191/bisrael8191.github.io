### Life story
After graduating from [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu) I moved down to the
Washington D.C. metro area and have enjoyed living, working, and exploring the area every day since.
I am a an engineer at heart and like working in the fast-paced, rapidly changing software field. I
tend to be happiest when working on a challenging problem that forces me to learn and/or relearn
new technology, ideas, languages, and tools every day.


### Technology interests
I tend to go for breadth when it comes to technology, so I'm not going to play Buzzword Bingo
and list everything that shows up when googling 'programming'. Below is a short list of topics
and technology that I've used for work or I have a real interest in. 

* Languages used at my current job: Java, C++, Python, Javascript (NodeJS and React)
* Languages I've played around with: Go, Ruby, C#
* Languages I want to learn: Nim, Rust, D
* Software defined radios
* Embedded: Arduino, Edison
* Cloud: Kubernetes, CoreOS with Etcd, Fleet, and Flannel
* Databases: RethinkDB, Cassandra, MongoDB
* Upcoming topics: Machine learning, data science
